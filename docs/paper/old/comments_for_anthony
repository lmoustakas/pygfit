You mentioned the need to specify exactly what the residuals were (i.e. pixel residuals or total flux residuals).  I've decided to go ahead and remove mention of the exact level of the residuals.  The problem, I think, is that I haven't really had a chance to look at this particular issue and quantify just how bad (or not) these residuals really are.  The number I put in there was a number I came up after taking a quick look at the images and catalogs.  I'm not sure how well it would really show up under scrutiny.  What I do know is that the simulations show that pygfit does fine, even in ch1 and ch2 where these residuals exist, and even for simulated objects which have residuals left over.  So what I do know for sure, and what is the most important part, is that while these residuals do exist, they are at worst a minor problem.

As it turns out, I actually couldn't find a good example of a very blue object, i.e. something that was invisible in F160W but bright in Bw (bright enough to mess up pygfit).  What I did find was a very red object: something completely invisible in F160W but very bright in ch2.  I found one such object on the very first image I checked, so I'm guessing these are somewhat common (probably at least 5-10 in all our images).  Doesn't necessarily need to be mentioned in the text, but any idea what this would be?  I would guess a high redshift ULIRG or something like that... certainly something high redshift in any case.
