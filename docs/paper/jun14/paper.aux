\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Three examples of cases where PyGFit{} can fail. The top row of panels shows the F160W images used to create the HRC. The center row of panels shows the LRI with the same field of view, while the bottom row of panels shows the residuals of the LRI after fitting. The LRI for the left uses ground-based R band imaging, while the example in the center is taken from the $4.5\mu $m imaging and the example on the right is taken from the IRAC $3.6\mu $m imaging. The left column shows a galaxy with extended features which cannot be described by a S\'{e}rsic{} profile. The center column shows a galaxy which is isolated in F160W but which is blended with another source in $4.5\mu $m. The right column shows a galaxy near the edge of the F160W image which is blended with a bright source which is outside of the F160W image. Further details are in the text.}}{7}{}}
